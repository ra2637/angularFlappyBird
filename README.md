## Knowledges
This is a very simple demo to show how easy and structural angularJS while implement such a game.
We only use 2 directives and one controller to simulate the game.
- Directives: pipe and bird to deal with each pipe and bird location and key event. 
- Controller: MainCtrl to control the whole game cycle, bird and pipes' position, and also collision detect.
